# Heart-Attack

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States (CDC, 2021). There is someone who has a heart attack every 40 seconds. About 805,000 people have a heart attack each year in the United States. Heart disease costs a huge burden of $239.9 billion each year. It is therefore important to identify specific demographic, medical, and health and lifestyle risk profiles of heart attack to inform more targeted prevention and interventions.
